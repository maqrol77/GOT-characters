# GOT-characters
This is an application that fetches and renders data taken from https://thronesapi.com/api/v2/Characters using React and Axios. The application takes the data from the API and creates a list of characters from the HBO series "Games of Thrones" where you can choose any of the characters and then it will display the character's image and information through a dynamic card.
